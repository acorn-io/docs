Acorn is a fully managed developer platform for deploying and running cloud-native apps on the public cloud. With Acorn, there is no infrastructure or container orchestration required. You use familiar development and deployment workflow based on mainstream container tools without having to deal with provisioning or configuring cloud resources.

## Key Features

### Acorn Image

Acorn Image offers a holistic solution for developers to seamlessly manage and deploy applications. By encapsulating both the application and its associated dependencies, including cloud services, within a singular Acornfile, users can build and package this configuration into a cohesive OCI (Open Container Initiative) artifact. This ensures consistent and streamlined deployment processes. Acorn also simplifies defining and using secrets in a containerized application by removing the need to generate the secrets beforehand.

### Developer Experience Reimagined

 Keep your workflow familiar and efficient with Acorn's personalized developer experience. Through a singular CLI, the deployment and management of both containerized applications and cloud services are realized. You can easily extend familiar workflow based on container management tools like Docker CLI to package, deploy, and manage Acorns.

### AWS Management and Acorn Cloud

Start your Acorn journey with Acorn Cloud, the pre-configured sandbox environment, which is perfect for deploying Acorns. When it's time to transition to a production setting, Acorn extends the flexibility of integrating your personal AWS account. Simply input your AWS access key and secret key to decide which account and region to target your deployments.

### Acorn Services  

Acorn Services expose a consistent interface for data services. Allowing you to swap out containers for and managed cloud services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS all through Acorn. When you attach an AWS account you will have access through a dedicated service catalog. This catalog facilitates the discovery of these AWS based services, enabling their seamless integration with containerized applications.

### Comprehensive View with App Dashboard

 Acorn's App Dashboard, a centralized hub, is designed for the comprehensive management of containerized applications and cloud services. This dashboard offers immediate access to various features, ranging from shell access, logs, events, to deep insights into your running applications.

### Enhanced Project Management

Improve collaboration and manage who has access to what with Acorn's project management features. With the integration with GitHub, it's easier than ever to establish nuanced, role-based access controls, ensuring the right people have the right access. You can easily define development, staging, and production environments and switch between them seamlessly. Project management also includes the ability to isolate applications with their own access controls and deployment rules.

Acorn can provision and manage AWS infrastructure in your own AWS account. By providing Acorn with AWS Keys, Acorn will provision roles and policies in your account to allow it to manage the infrastructure needed to run your application.

Once Acorn is managing your environment, developers can deploy Acorns that provision AWS services such as RDS, DynamoDB, and SQS. Developers can describe these services in their own Acornfiles and the resources will follow the same lifecycle as the application.

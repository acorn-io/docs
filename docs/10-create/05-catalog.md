Existing Acorn images are available in the Acorn catalog. You can browse the catalog and deploy directly from it within the UI.

## Deploying an Image

To deploy an Acorn image from the catalog, click the "Create" button from within the project view. Then select "From Catalog". Next, you can assign a name, or let one like `proud-frog` be generated for you. Then select the image you would like to deploy. You can select MariaDB and click next. Here you can configure the autoupgrade settings. Once configured, you can click the create button to deploy.

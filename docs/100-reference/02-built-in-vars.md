title: Built-in Variables
---

Acorn provides built in variables to help you configure your application when deploying on Acorn.

## Acorn Variables

These variables are useful in tagging resources in cloud providers and other systems. When creating resources the `externalID` is a good choice for a unique name that ties back to the Acorn deployment.

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| @{acorn.account} | The Acorn account name |
| @{acorn.project} | The Acorn project name |
| @{acorn.name} | The name of the Acorn deployment |
| @{acorn.namespace} | The name of the of the running Acorn namespace |
| @{acorn.image} | The image ID of the Acorn image |
| @{acorn.imagename} | The name of the Acorn image |
| @{acorn.commitsha} | The Git commit SHA the Acorn image was built from |
| @{acorn.externalID} | A unique identifier for the Acorn deployment that can be used with external systems. |

## Service Variables

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| @{services.[container name].endpoint} | This provides the generated endpoint name for a container with a published port. The value is generated by Acorn. |
| @{services.[service name].address} | Address to connect to the service. It is defined as part of the service. |
| @{services.[service name].port.[port number]} | Port to connect to the service. The port number is the common port for the service. For instance a db service providing MySQL would have `@{services.db.port.3306}` |
| @{services.[service name].data.[service author defined keys]} | The data for a service is defined by the author of the service. This is a way for the author to pass information about the service, like a database name, or AWS ARN. |
| @{services.[service name].secrets.[secret name].[secret key]} | The secrets that are exposed for a service. The names and keys are defined by the author of the service. |

Sharing Acorn links provides a way to distribute and share applications with others. A user who receives the link will have the ability to deploy the Acorn with a single click into a sandbox to try out. Open source and commercial projects can post this link on their READMEs and websites to allow users to quickly try their software. As the creator of the Acorn link, you can also gain visibility into the number of times your link has been used to deploy your software over time.

## Use cases

* Enable new contributors to a project. By launching the application, new users and potential contributors can quickly get started with the application. If the application is open source, they can clone the repo and make changes to the application and see their changes deployed in real time. Once they are done, they can pull request back to the project.

* Quickly setup training environments. If you are running a training session, you can provide a link to the Acorn that contains all of the software needed for the training. This allows users to quickly get started with the training without having to install any software on their machines.

* Provide a demo environment. If you are running a demo of your software, you can provide a link to the Acorn that contains all of the software needed for the demo. This allows users to quickly get started with the demo without having to install any software on their machines.
